## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Slack MCP Server seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Where to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to [your-security-email@domain.com] with the following information:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### What to Expect

- We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- We will provide a detailed response within 7 days indicating next steps
- We will notify you when the vulnerability is fixed
- We may ask for additional information or guidance

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit sensitive data like Slack tokens to the repository
2. **Dependencies**: Keep all dependencies up to date and regularly audit them
3. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize inputs from external sources
4. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
5. **Logging**: Don't log sensitive data like tokens or user personal information

### For Deployment

1. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Use `env.example.json` as a template
   - Never commit actual `env.json` with real credentials
   - Use environment variables in production

2. **Network Security**:
   - Run the server behind a reverse proxy
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Implement rate limiting

3. **Access Control**:
   - Limit Slack bot permissions to minimum required scopes
   - Regularly rotate Slack tokens
   - Use separate tokens for different environments

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Monitor application logs for suspicious activity
   - Set up alerts for unusual API usage patterns
   - Track failed authentication attempts

### Required Slack Bot Permissions

The minimum required Slack permissions are:

- `channels:read` - List public channels
- `chat:write` - Send messages to channels
- `reactions:write` - Add reactions to messages
- `im:read` - Read direct messages (if DM features are used)
- `users:read` - Read user information

**Never grant more permissions than necessary.**

## Security Features

### Built-in Security

- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated using Pydantic models
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated dependency vulnerability scanning via GitHub Actions

### Security Tools

We use the following tools to maintain security:

- **Bandit**: Static security analysis for Python code
- **Safety**: Vulnerability scanning for Python dependencies
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Automated security checks before commits
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Automated vulnerability detection

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Preserve evidence
   - Assess the scope of the incident

2. **Notification**:
   - Notify stakeholders within 24 hours
   - Provide regular updates during investigation

3. **Recovery**:
   - Implement fixes and patches
   - Update security measures
   - Conduct post-incident review

## Security Updates

Security updates will be:

- Released as soon as possible after verification
- Clearly marked in release notes
- Communicated through GitHub Security Advisories
- Backported to supported versions when necessary

## Compliance

This project aims to follow:

- OWASP Top 10 security principles
- Industry standard secure coding practices
- Slack API security guidelines
- OAuth 2.0 security best practices
